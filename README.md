# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repo was built in accordance with the Tech Academy's HTML and CSS course work.

This repo is incredibly unorganized and purley for educational purposes only and not for publication.

In this repo we went over basic HTML and basic css resulting in the completion of a portfolio website currently live at http://learningonlinux.com

Thanks!
